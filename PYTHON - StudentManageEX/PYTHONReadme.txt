Honestly, because I'm not entirely familiar with the dynamic typing rules, the vagueness made this slightly harder to understand. I made sure to note one particular place in which I use a fancy function to filter an populate a list, except there's nothing that identifies it as a list in the function, so it confused me a bit when I was trying to work on it. Overall though, it was nice to be able to use so many complex functions with such simplicity. The lambda function in particular was interesting for sorting and was extremely simplified compared to Java.
