Given that in this example I am using arrays with fixed size, memory management and array handling isn't as complicated as I would've thought. I will say however, propeprly figuring out the pointer system for my loops did make it both harder, but also more interesting, than java.
Also, being able to put all my code in a single class with it simply flowing down seems very nice to me, though I'm sure this changes as programs get larger.
